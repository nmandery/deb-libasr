 As far as I am concerned, the code I have written for this software
 can be used freely for any purpose.  Any derived versions of this
 software must be clearly marked as such, and if the derived work is
 incompatible with the protocol description in the RFC file, it must be
 called by a name other than "ssh" or "Secure Shell".
